# VNaaS utility scripts

Used to generate the data for VNaaS.

`disas_asm.sh`: Generates disassembly from HCB files.

`disas_text.sh`: Generates text from HCB files.

`gen_db.sh`: Generates a SQLite database. Use if you don't have any kind
of restrictions on your server.

`gen_py.sh`: Generates Python "database" scripts. Use if you are not
allowed to access files/databases on your server (e.g. GAE/Heroku)

`dl_patch.sh`: This is how I get the HCB files. Is it legal? Ehh... Maybe?
I mean, the files are publicly available, right?
