### What about <novel name here>?

Unfortunately, reverse engineering games is a tedious process, and I am
just a student with an unhealthy addiction for visual novels. If you
wish to see your favorite game added to the list, you will likely have
to obtain the data yourself.

### My game has a fansub, will it be added to the database?

No, only official translations are allowed.

### What can I use this for?

Use your imagination! Examples include:

- Browser homepage
- Twitter bot
- Email signature

### Shut up and take my donations!

Please support the developers of the games instead, they're the ones who
truly make this possible!

Of course, you may donate your time and effort instead - those are greatly
appreciated :-)
